# Javascript_Labs
A miscellaneous collection of JS labs at school

Hi there,

I am Ludo and I started this year a transition into the Web development world. To that end, I went back to school to learn more technical skills.

This repository is a miscellaneous collection of the JavaScript labs I have programmed at school. I hope that it can be of help to anybody who is starting like me. It is also a way for me to conviniently have useful short JS programs available to build bigger ones.

Cheers!
